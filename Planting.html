<h2>Why Start Seedlings?</h2>
<p>I'm sure that almost all of us have been to the garden center of a hardware or grocery store, and we've seen all of those beautiful
plants that have already begun growing.  Started plants like these are good if you got a late start on your garden or are only planting a couple
of plants.  However, starting seedlings is much cheaper, and can help you manage plant disease and infection.  I also find it extremely rewarding
to see them start from nothing and grow into somehting delicous and fresh.

<h2>How To Start Seedlings</h2>
<h3>Supplies</h3>

<div style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:top;">
<ul>
<li>Sterile Seed Starter</li>
<li>Planting Tray OR Egg Carton</li>
<li>Seed For Your Plant Of Choice</li>
<li>Spray Bottle And/Or Anything With a Pour Spout</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>ALAYS READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST!! Your seeds should come with instructions outlining when to plant, what depth, and any other information
specific to that plant.</li>
<li>Prepare your planting tray.  You don't need to buy any fancy planting trays if you don't want to.  Plants will start in just about any container
as long as all of the correct environmental factors are met.  An egg carton makes a great starting container.  If you are using a repurposed container,
make sure that you add drainage holes to the bottom.  This will allow the soil to stay moist while helping to prevent over watering.  For an egg carton,
you can use a screw driver to poke perfect sized holes in the bottom of each of the cells.</li>
<li>Once you have your planting tray, you want to fill the cells almost all the way up with a sterile seed starter mix.  You can tap the tray against the
the counter in order to help the soil settle, but refrain from compacting it with your hands.  You want it to be light and airy to encourage root growth
You need to make sure it is STERILE.  This is what will help to prevent disease in your garden.</li>
<li>Double check the instructions that came with your seeds to determine the planting depth, and plant accordingly.  I usually spritz the soil with a
spray bottle, but a watering can, measuring cup, or anything with a pour spout will work.  You want to make sure that the soil is moist, but not soaking
wet.</li>
<li>Now that your seeds are in soil, you need to maintain moisture and warmth.  Don't let those seeds dry out!  Warm soil encourages germination and root growth early on.</li>
<li>Once the seeds sprout and the plants are about 2in tall, you need to make sure they are getting a good amount of sunlight.  You can set them in front of a 
window, or if the weather is nice, set them outside durring the warm and sunny part of the day.</li>
<li>Once your seedlings are mature enough, transplant them into your garden!  The instructions that came with your seeds should provide you with a timeline for translplant.  Every plant is different.</li>
