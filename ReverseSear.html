<h1>How To Reverse Sear a Steak</h1>
<h2>What Is Reverse Searing, and Why?</h2>
<p>Reverse searing is the process of first cooking the meat to your preferred temperature using a low gentle heat (usually an oven), and then searing the outside at a very high heat.  There are two major benefits to reverse searing, especially 
something like a steak.</p>  
	<ol>
		<li>When you cook meat at a high temperature, the muscle fibers in the meat contract at push out moisture.  If you slowly bring the maeat up to your preferred temperature, you keep the meat relaxed and it retains that moisture.</li>
		<li>You can more accurately control the final temperature of your meat.  If you pefer your steak cooked medium-rare for example, you can stop cooking it when reaches 135 degrees.  There is very little risk of over or undercooking it.</li>
	</ol>
