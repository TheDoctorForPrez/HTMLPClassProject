<h1>How To Reverse Sear a Steak</h1>
<h2>What Is Reverse Searing, and Why?</h2>
<p>Reverse searing is the process of first cooking the meat to your preferred temperature using a low gentle heat (usually an oven), and then searing the outside at a very high heat.  There are two major benefits to reverse searing, especially 
something like a steak.</p>  
	<ol>
		<li>When you cook meat at a high temperature, the muscle fibers in the meat contract and push out moisture.  If you slowly bring the maeat up to your preferred temperature, you keep the meat relaxed and it retains that moisture.</li>
		<li>You can more accurately control the final temperature of your meat.  If you pefer your steak cooked medium-rare for example, you can stop cooking it when reaches 135 degrees.  There is very little risk of over or undercooking it.</li>
	</ol>
<h2>How To Reverse Sear a Steak</h2>
<h3>Supplies</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Sheet Pan</li>
	<li>Wire Cooking Rack</li>
	<li>Meat Thermometer</li>
	<li>Frying Pan (not non-stick)</li>
	<li>Olive Oil (Vegetble or Canola will work fine as well)</li>
	<li>Steak of your choice (I prefer a 1-1 1/2 inch thick Rib-Eye)</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat your oven to 225 degrees. While it is heating, generously season your steak with salt and place it on a wire rack that is in a sheet pan.</li>
	<li>When the oven is preheated, move the steak to the oven.  After 20 minutes, check the temperature to see if it has reached the level that you would like. Be sure to check every few minutes until you get there. Once it has reched the correct temperature, remove it from the oven and let it rest on the wire rack until it has cooled to about room temperature.

	<li>Begin to pre-heat your frying pan on the stove top, but be careful not to use a non-stick pan.  High heats will damage the non-stick coating, and can sometimes release toxic chemicals into the food.  You will know the pan is hot enough when a drop of water placed in the pan beads up and sort of dances around. </li>
	<li>When the pan reaches temperature, place enough oil in it to lightly cover the entire bottom of the pan. Place the steak in the pan, and flip after 30 seconds.  You're looking for a nice golden brown crust on both sides, a sign that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard Reaction</a> has taken place.  Flip back an forth until you acheive this on both sides</li>
	<li>Let the steak rest for 4-5 minutes.  This will allow the muscle fibers that tightened durring the sear to relax, and prevent moisture loss when you cut into it.</li>
	<li>Eat!!  It's that easy!</li>

<p>This is my favorite way to cook a steak.  Another method you can try is Sous Vide, which is using a specialized tool to heat water bath to very specific temperatures.  With Sous Vide, you can experiment with cooking meats in in marinades, with herbs, and other things to impart more flavor.  Also, remember that the thickness of the meat is going to be the biggest factor in cooking time.  Adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>In the video below, you will notice that Babish has a few variances to his method and recipe.  What I gave you was the very base essentials to reverse searing.  Please, explore whenever you are comfortable!  Try butter basting, adding herbs to the pan, marinading, seasoning more exotically...whatever makes you happy!
My last piece of advice to you is this, there is no wrong way to eat a steak.  There may be some steak elitists out there that swear up and down that Med-Rare is the ONLY WAY to eat a steak!  Don't listen to them. If you like it well done, eat it well done.</p>
