<h1>All About Me</h1>

<h2>Who Is Zach?</h2>

<p1>Hello!  My name is Zachary Hannah, and this web page is built to tell you about me.  I am 32 years old, married to a wonderful woman, and father to four.
I am currently living in New Jersey, but I have aslo lived in Oregon, Ohio, and Hawaii.  My job tends to take me many new places, some of them great, some of them...not great, lol.</p>

<h3>My Interests</h3>

<p>Let's talk about three of my hobbies/interests.  Bourbon!  I am a <em>big fan</em> of bourbon.  Not just drinking it (which I do love to do), but also learning about it.  
I find the process of making bourbon and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey">history</a> behind the spirit itself to be very interesting.</p> 

<p>The next one, is cooking.  Cooking is one of my favorite things to do, and what I hope to be doing for a living one day. I really enjoy trying new things in the kitchen and cooking new dishes that
teach me new techniques or skills.  This is another hobby that I enjoy learning about almost as much as I enjoy doing.  My most recent cooking adventure was tamales!  They were not as difficult as 
I thought they would be and I reccomend you <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/how-to-make-tamales/">give cooking them a try<a/> sometime.</p>

<p>Finally, gardening.  I feel like this one goes hand in hand with cooking.  Using fresh ingredients just makes for better food.  Gardening is also something that I find challenging at times.  It seems
I am alway doing research whenever I grow something new, or whenever I have a new issue with anyghing that I am growing...which happens often.  In the end, there are very few tasks that make feel as 
accomplished as planting seeds to see something grow from almost nothing. It takes some patience, and some frustrating trial and error, but I really enjoy it.  Buying pre-started plants from a garden
store is a great way to start, but I find it more rewarding when you <a href="https://www.almanac.com/starting-seeds-indoors-how-and-when-start-seeds">start your own seedlings</a>.</p>
