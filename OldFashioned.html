<h2>Defining The Perfect Old Fashioned</h2>
<p>As you probably know by reading my About Me page, I am passionate about bourbon.  You can drink it neat, on the, rocks, mixed with coke, or any way that enjoy it.
I truly believe that there is no wrong way to drink bourbon, as long as you are enjoying it.  However, in my <i>personal</i> opinion there is one true and best way to
make an old fashioned.  It is one of the simpleist, yet most commonly butchered bourbon cocktails.  Some people make it WAY too sweet, or add soda water too it.  Maybe
they muddle an orange slice into it as well.  A "Perfect Old Fashioned" should contain only six ingredients.</p>

<h2>How To Make The Perfect Old Fashioned</h2>
<h3>Ingredients/Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 oz. Bourbon (preferrably with a high-rye content)</li>
<li>Bitters (Angostura is the industry standard, however any good quality bitters will work)</li>
<li>One Sugar Cube OR 1tsp White GranulatedSugar OR 1.5tsp Simple Syrup</li>
<li>Cocktail Muddler OR Wooden Spoon</li>
<li>Fresh orange</li>
<li>Sharp Paring Knife</li>
<li>Ice</li>
<li>Candied Cherries (Luxardo is a great brand)</li>
<li>Rocks Glass</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place your swettener of choice in the rocks glass and add 3 dashes of bitters.  You can adjust more or less depending on your preference.  If you are using a sugar cube
or granulated sugar, also add about a teaspoon of water. </li>
<li>Using a cocktail muddler, or the handle end of a wooden spoon, grind the sugar into the bitters and water until it is mostly disolved.  If you are using simplye syrup
you don't need to muddle.</li>
<li>Add your 2oz. of bourbon and stir.</li>
<li>Add your ice to the glass.  I prefer to use one large ice cube to help keep the cocktail from watering down too much as you drink.</li>
<li>Peel a strip of the orange about 1/2 inch wide and 2-3 inches long.  Try to just take off the skin of the orange, not taking any of the pith with it.  Gently fold the strip in half 
long way to form a "U" shape. holding it over the glass, squeez the edges together to express the oils from the orange peel onto the top of the cocktail.</li>
<li>Place the orange peel on top of the ice, and garnish with a candied cherry.  You can use a maraschino cherry, but I prefer to skip the cherry completely if that's my only choice.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
